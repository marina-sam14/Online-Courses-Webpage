## Dynamic Development Folder
### Frontend and Backend development. <br>
 - In the Frontend, we used the Web API [here](https://elearning-aueb.herokuapp.com/courses/) in order to fetch our data. We also used Handlebars in order to create a dynamic list of the course AUEB offers for remote learning. We created a search bar where you can type some keyword to search for a specific course. We used [this version of that Web API. **Attention, put a keyword in the end**](https://elearning-aueb.herokuapp.com/courses/search?title=`keyword`) <br>
Images are located [here](https://elearning-aueb.herokuapp.com/static/images/{img}) <br>
Also, in courses.html, we can search via URL using the category id. Categories ids and titles are located in an aside at your left. <br>
 - Backend contains a Node.js server for our Register form to be valid. We used Constraint Validation API and some restrictions on username and passwords. We used Express framework. too.
